<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The standard PHPUnit assertion methods such as <em><code>assertEquals</code></em>, expect the first argument to be the expected value and the
second argument to be the actual value. Swap them, and your test will still have the same outcome (succeed/fail when it should) but the error messages
will be confusing.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when the second argument to an assertions library method is a hard-coded value and the first argument is not.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
self::assertEquals($runner.getExitCode(), 0, "Unexpected exit code"); // Noncompliant; Failed asserting that 0 matches expected 3. Expected :3 Actual :0.
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
self::assertEquals(0, $runner.getExitCode(), "Unexpected exit code");
</pre>
