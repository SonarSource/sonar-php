<p>Shared coding conventions make it possible for a team to collaborate efficiently. This rule raises issues for failures to comply with formatting

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<p>With the default PSR2 parameter values:</p>
<pre>

  function my_function(){  // Noncompliant; curly brace on wrong line
    if ($firstThing)       // Noncompliant; an open curly brace should be at the end of line for a control structure
    {
      ...
    }

      ...
    }

      ...
    }
    else {                 // Noncompliant; the close curly brace and the next "else" (or "catch" or "finally") keyword should be located on the same line
      ...
    }

      ...
    } catch (Exception $e) {
    }

      ...
    }

    pressJuice($apply ,$orange);    // Noncompliant; the comma should be followed by one space and not preceded by any

    do_something ();       // Noncompliant; there should not be any space after the method name

    foreach ($fruits    as $fruit_key =&gt;     $fruit) {  // Noncompliant; in the foreach statement there should be one space before and after "as" keyword and "=&gt;" operator
      ...
    }
  }
}

{

}
