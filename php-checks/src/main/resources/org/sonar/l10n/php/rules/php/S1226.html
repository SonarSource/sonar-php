<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>While it is technically correct to assign to parameters from within function bodies, doing so before the parameter value is read is likely a bug.
Instead, initial values of parameters should be, if not treated as read-only, then at least read before reassignment.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
function foo($str, $array) {
  $str = "name; // Noncompliant

  foreach ($array as $item) {
    $item = "hello world";  // Noncompliant
  }
}
</pre>
