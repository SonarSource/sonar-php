<p>Signalling processes is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0390">CVE-2009-0390</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0839">CVE-2002-0839</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1671">CVE-2008-1671</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Sending signals without checking properly which process will receive it can cause a denial of service.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> the PID of the process to which the signal will be sent is coming from an untrusted source. It could for example come from a world-writable
  file. </li>
  <li> users who are asking for the signal to be sent might not have the permission to send those signals. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> If the signal is sent because of a user’s request. Check that the user is allowed to send this signal. You can for example forbid it if the
  user doesn’t own the process. </li>
  <li> Secure the source from which the process PID is read. </li>
  <li> Run the process sending the signals with minimal permissions. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>

posix_kill(42, 42); // Sensitive
