<p><code>sleep</code> is sometimes used in a mistaken attempt to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by throttling response rate. But because it
ties up a thread, each request takes longer to serve that it otherwise would, making the application <em>more</em> vulnerable to DoS attacks, rather
than less.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>

  sleep(5);  // Noncompliant
