<p>PHP's <code>session.use_trans_sid</code> automatically appends the user's session id to urls when cookies are disabled. On the face of it, this
seems like a nice way to let uncookie-able users use your site anyway. In reality, it makes those users vulnerable to having their sessions hijacked
by anyone who might:</p>
<ul>
  <li> see the URL over the user's shoulder </li>
  <li> be sent the URL by the user </li>
  <li> retrieve the URL from browser history </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul>
<p>For that reason, it's better to practice a little "tough love" with your users and force them to turn on cookies.</p>
<p>Since <code>session.use_trans_sid</code> is off by default, this rule raises an issue when it is explicitly enabled.</p>
