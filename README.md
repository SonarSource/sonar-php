This SonarSource project is a [static code analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) for PHP language used as an extension for the [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) platform. It will allow you to produce stable and easily supported [Clean Code](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/clean-code/) by helping you find and correct bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.


# Features
* 200+ rules
* Supports up to PHP 8.4
* Metrics (complexity, number of lines, etc.)
* Import of [unit test and coverage results](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/coverage/)
* Support of [custom rules](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/languages/php/)

Have questions or feedback?
---------------------------

To provide feedback (request a feature, report a bug, etc.) use the [SonarSource Community Forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/). Please do not forget to specify the language (PHP!), plugin version, and SonarQube version.

If you have a question on how to use plugin (and the [docs](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/languages/php/) don't help you), we also encourage you to use the community forum.

# Contributing

### Topic in SonarSource Community Forum

To request a new feature, please create a new thread in [SonarSource Community Forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/). Even if you plan to implement it yourself and submit it back to the community, please start a new thread first to be sure that we can follow up on it.

### Pull Request (PR)
To submit a contribution, create a pull request for this repository. Please make sure that you follow our [code style](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-developer-toolset) and that all [tests](#testing) are passing.

### Custom Rules
If you have an idea for a rule, but you are not sure that everyone needs it you can implement a [custom rule](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/languages/php/) available only for you.

#### Custom Rules API Changes
- **3.32** (October 2023)
    * Additional `newIssue` endpoint added to the `CheckContext` API interface
- **3.15** (January 2021)
    * `PHPCustomRulesDefinition` was removed, it was deprecated since version 2.13 (March 2018)
    * Removed dependency on sslr-squid-bridge which is not maintained anymore
- **3.11**, support of PHP 8:
    * `ParameterTree#type()` is deprecated. Use `ParameterTree#declaredType()` instead.
    * `ReturnTypeClauseTree#type()` is deprecated. Use `ReturnTypeClauseTree#declaredType()` instead.
    * `ClassPropertyDeclarationTree#typeAnnotation()` is deprecated. Use `ClassPropertyDeclarationTree#declaredType()` instead.
    * `CatchBlockTree#variable()` can now return `NULL`.
    * `FunctionCallTree#arguments()` is deprecated. Use `FunctionCallTree#callArguments()` instead.
    * `AnonymousClassTree#arguments()` is deprecated. Use `AnonymousClassTree#callArguments()` instead.
    * New tree: `CallArgumentTree`. This tree wraps expressions passed as arguments now.   
    * New kind of expression: `ThrowExpressionTree`.
    * New kind of expression: `MatchExpressionTree`.
    * `ParameterTree` now has a `visibility` method.
    

# <a name="testing"></a>Testing
To run tests locally follow these instructions.

To configure build dependencies, run the following command:

```shell
git submodule update --init -- build-logic/common
```

To always get the latest version of the build logic during git operations, set the following configuration:

```shell
git config submodule.recurse true
```

### Build the Project and Run Unit Tests
To build the plugin and run its unit tests, execute this command from the project's root directory:
```shell
./gradlew build
```

### Integration Tests
To run integration tests, you will need to create a properties file like the one shown below, and set its location in an environment variable named `ORCHESTRATOR_CONFIG_URL`.
```properties
# version of SonarQube server
sonar.runtimeVersion=9.9
```
Before running any of the integration tests make sure the submodules are checked out:
```shell
  git submodule update --init
```
#### Plugin Test
The "Plugin Test" is an additional integration test that verifies plugin features such as metric calculation, coverage, etc. To launch it:
```shell
./gradlew its:plugin:integrationTest
```

#### Ruling Test
The "Ruling Test" is a special integration test that launches the analysis of a large code base, saves the issues created by the plugin in report files, and then compares those results to the set of expected issues (stored as JSON files). To launch the ruling test:
```shell
./gradlew its:ruling:integrationTest
```

This test gives you the opportunity to examine the issues created by each rule and make sure they're what you expect. You can inspect new/lost issues by checking the SonarQube local URL mentioned in the logs at the end of the analysis.
If everything looks good to you, you can copy the file with the actual issues located at
```
sonar-php/its/ruling/target/actual/
```
into the directory with the expected issues
```
sonar-php/its/ruling/src/test/resources/expected/
```

### Rule Descriptions

#### Update Rule Descriptions

To update all rule descriptions:

```shell
./gradlew ruleApiUpdate
```

#### Generate New Rule Description

To fetch static files for a rule SXXXX from [RSPEC](https://github.com/SonarSource/rspec):

```shell
./gradlew ruleApiGenerateRule -Prule=SXXXX
```

Same for a specific RSPEC branch (`master` by default):

```shell
./gradlew ruleApiGenerateRule -Prule=SXXXX -Pbranch=my-branch
```
